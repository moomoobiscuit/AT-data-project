# Auckland Transport Data Project

Just a side project where I experiment with the data science workflow within Python.

I use data from the Auckland Transport API, available at the [AT Developer Portal](https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz/).

Work in progress, will be updating when I find new directions in the project. One idea is to use the available data to perform prediction of delays of bus services.
